I'm continuing to build out little notion-related tools while automating the publishing of this blog.

This one is pretty small and self-contained. [notion-log-sync](https://github.com/adjective-object/notion-log-exec) runs a shell command, records the output, and posts it back to a row with a matching name in a notion CollectionRow.



[Check it on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/notion-log-exec/)!



I've had a fun time automating the CI/CD process to publish package revisions immediately from github. Maybe I'll write a follow-up post about automating the deployment process? We'll see.. ðŸ˜›
